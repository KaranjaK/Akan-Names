        <h1>Akan <span>Names</span></h1>
        <p>
            <span>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week</span>
            <span>they were born and the order in which they were born. These "day names" have further</span>
            <span>meanings concerning the soul and character of the person. Middle names have considerably</span>
            <span>more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.</span>
            <span>Most Ghanaians have at least one name from this system, even if they also have an English </span>
            <span>or Christian name. Notable figures with day names include Ghana's first president Kwame </span>
            <span>Nkrumah and former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</span>
